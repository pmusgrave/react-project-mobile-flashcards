# Mobile Flashcards
### A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Installation Instructions
```
npm install
npm start web
```

Site will be served via expo at http://localhost:19006/

Use the QR code that is displayed in the console to test on a smartphone. 

Note: I've only been able to test this on Android, so I can't comment on how well it looks or works on iOS. I had some issues getting an iOS simulator up and running.

If there are issues running the `npm start web` command, it may be necessary to run with sudo privileges.
